super() is there in all of the constructor 
every class exteend to the object
like: public classs A extends to Object;
if we use the this() in the constructor then it will call the un parameterized constructor and then it will call the extends class

// Camel Casting

// class interface - Calc , Runable 
// veriables andd methods - marks , show();
// constants like env cons - PIE , URI 

final class cannot be inherited
make method final to stop overriding also in simple final keywird to make it constant it cannot be changed

 abstract class simply define it and make the class LAO ABSTRACT AND THEN USE IT LATER ON 
 we also have the inner calss we define the method where we define the object understood

 interface - its basically a class where by default evey method or lass is public abstract

 we have to male a class and then to implement the interface we have to mimplement that abstract 
 now we have to define all the methods or we have to make that class also thr abstract class 

in interface by default all the variables are final and static sp we have to also deine its value when defining it

if we have to change th area we can't cause it final and static

ca a ckass multiple interface then its YES
well we can extends the interface of one in another interface

//class - class -> extends;
// class - inteface -> implements
// inteface - interface -> extends

ENUMS:


Annotations - we have lots of them kindly read the documentation for this it would be much better 

Types of intefaces
1. Normal - normal one that we use two or more method
2. Functional/SAM -  if only one method 
3. Marker - no methods means blank interface , just used to store 

(read serialization and deserialization for the lasat marker storing method usage)

Functional interface - we can only use the lambda expression ith the functional inteface only 

LAMBDA EXPRESSION : ->
Ex: A obj = () -> 
            {
                System.out.println("asdf);
            }

            we eliminated (new A() 
            the {
                pulic noid show(){
                    Sout("asdf);
                }
            })
More example : A obj = (i , j) -> i + j;


Exceptions : 
1. Compile type  error
2. Run time error -> exceptions
3. Logical Error

we handle the exception using the try and catch

Keywords:
throw : read its usage in documentation 


Take input : Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in)
             int num = sc.nextInt();


Threads : use it for the multiple processing not one byone but simultaneously one y one

Mutations : we can change something like variables or something 
            (strings are inmutable)

Race Condition: syncronized keyword to use to allow only one thread to word at a same time 

NOw we have lots of states 
start()
run()
sleep()
wait()
stop()


COLLECTION:
1. Collection API
2. COllection interface
3. Collections (CLass)

LIST API's we have so many of them read the documentations for the simpler explanation for eacch of the following collections we have for it
 
see the use of Stream in he collections


LVTI :

Sealed Classes:
read documentation

Record Classes: 


JDBC:

1. Import the packages(java.sql*)
2. Load and register the drivers 
    a.Load the drivver
     (com.mysql.jdbc.driver)
    mysql.connector

    b. Register the driver(forName("com.mysql.jdbc.driver))


3. Establish the connection
4. create the statemnt (statement -> prepared , collable)
5. Execute the query 
6. processing result
7.Close


Ex: 
import jva,sql.*
    main()
    {
        Class.forName("com.mysql.jdbc.Driver");
        Connection con = DriverNamager.getConnection("URL" , "User_Name" , "Pass") 
        Statemnt st = com.CreateStatement();
        ResultSet rs =   st.ExecuteQuery("SELECT * FROM student")

        while(rs.next()){
            rs.getInt(1) + " " + rs.getString(2);
        }
        
        st.close();
        con.close();
    }

    DDL 
    DML
    DQL

    These are in DBMS see the in the docu,entation
